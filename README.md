# Kollab

Set up instructions

1) create a new virtual environment following exactly the same steps as in the first assessment
* Python version 3.7.1  
* Django version 1.11.17...etc etc
* just change all the names from 'rango' to 'kollab'

2) However DONT clone or initiate a django project just yet

3) Make a github account and Fork (very important!) this repository (link: https://github.com/briancollins-92/Kollab.git )

3) Then, in your PC, Clone YOUR fork. Dont Clone my repo, clone your own dude.
* This means that you can keep your own up to date version of the master branch
* which allows you to mess things up without effecting anyone else
* do python manage.py runserver to check that it works

4) When you have your version...follow the Tango With Django book chapter 5 to achieve the following:
* migrate your database
* run the population script

5) Then do git checkout -b _branch-name_ to make a new branch and start working on whatever you want
