1) go to http://localhost:8000/kollab/

2) click 'Log In or Sign Up' or 'Get Started' to go to http://localhost:8000/kollab/login/ (There is a new
index page but I havent had the time to put it in yet)

3) A) If you want to sign in, it only works for profiles which you have made from the webpage, not profiles from the 
population script for some reason to do with (I think) password hashing that I haven't figured out yet. Basically
you can only sign in with profiles you have made from the front end!

Signing in with a user profile should lead to: http://localhost:8000/kollab/profile/<user_name_slug>/

If errors are made then a popup should notify that it was not successful

B) Otherwise, click Sign Up New Account to register a new account. If errors are made then a popup should notify that it was not successful

Upun registering, you should be takento http://localhost:8000/kollab/buildprofile/, which is currently only accessable when 
logged in. Enter whatever data youwant and then you will be signed in and directed to 
http://localhost:8000/kollab/profile/<user_name_slug>/

4) When finished visit http://localhost:8000/kollab/logoff/ to log off and it returns to the main page
